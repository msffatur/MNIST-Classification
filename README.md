# MNIST Classification

This repository contains my assignment in The Intelligence System Class. The MNIST used as the learning materials of handwritten digits. CNN-NN algorithm shows the difference between Deep Learning and Shallow Learning. RF-TSNE algorithm shows the T-SNE visualization of the handwritten digits after training with Random Forest Method.

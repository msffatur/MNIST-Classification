# MNIST Classification

This repository contains my assignment in The Intelligence System Class. The MNIST used as the learning materials for handwritten digit database. This algorithm shows the difference between Deep Learning using CNN and Shallow Learning using NN. Before, all the class member including me wrote our handwritten digit in a paper and scanned those paper as the tester. But it goes failed because the handwritten was too slim, so the system can't recognize it.
